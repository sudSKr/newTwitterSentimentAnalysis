# newTwitterSentimentAnalysis
Twitter sentiment analysis using NLTK in Python
This project has the ability to classify any tweets into either positive or negative.
The file "nlpTwitterSentimentAnalysisExecution.py" does the twitter data streaming and stores the classification in "twitterOutput.txt".
The file "nlpTwitterSentimentAnalysisGraph.py" uses that data to represent the sentiment of the twitter stream.
